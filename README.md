## 🌍 Executive Summary

**PhasQ** is an advanced geospatial analysis platform designed to detect early signs of drought and soil moisture anomalies. By leveraging **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** technology from the Sentinel-1 constellation, PhasQ sees through clouds and weather conditions to provide reliable, day-and-night soil dielectric assessment.

Unlike optical indices (NDVI) which only show vegetation stress *after* it occurs, PhasQ's **Physics Engine** analyzes the backscatter coefficient ($\sigma_0$) to estimate volumetric soil moisture directly, offering a leading indicator for water scarcity.

##  Key capabilities

## 🔬 The "Physicist" Engine
At the core of PhasQ is a proprietary analysis agent capable of processing raw satellite telemetry into actionable insights:
- **Radiometric Calibration**: Converts raw digital numbers into calibrated backscatter ($\sigma_0$ dB).
- **Speckle Filtering**: Implements **Lee Filtering** and advanced noise reduction to ensure signal clarity.
- **Incidence Angle Normalization**: Standardizes observations to a reference angle ($38^\circ$) for consistent temporal comparison.
- **Dielectric Analysis**: Maps radar reflectivity directly to soil moisture content using empirical physical models.

### 💻 Enterprise Frontend
- **Interactive AOI Selection**: Precision polygon drawing tools based on `Leaflet-Draw`.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Dynamic overlay of drought severity layers on global base maps.
- **Secure Architecture**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.
- **Reporting**: Automated generation of moisture analysis reports.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+
- Sentinel-1 Data Access (CDSE Account recommended for live data)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phasq-tech/core.git
```

2. **Backend Setup**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python standalone.py
```

3. **Frontend Setup**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The platform will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 🔬 Demo Mode vs. Production Data

**Default configuration runs in DEMO MODE** with simulated data for instant testing.

For **real Sentinel-1 SAR analysis**:
1. Register for free CDSE account: https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/
2. Follow setup guide: [`backend/REAL_DATA_QUICKSTART.md`](backend/REAL_DATA_QUICKSTART.md)
3. Configure CDSE credentials in `.env`

**Why Demo Mode?**
- ✅ Instant testing without satellite data downloads (~800MB per scene)
- ✅ Predictable results for development/debugging  
- ✅ No external dependencies or credentials needed

**Production Mode Features:**
- Real Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR data
- Physics-based processing with Lee filtering
- Ground-truth validated drought metrics
- Historical baseline comparisons

## 📊 Scientific Methodology

PhasQ implements a multi-stage analysis pipeline compliant with ESA recommendations:

1. **Ingestion**: Retrieval of Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products.
2. **Preprocessing**: Thermal noise removal and orbital correction.
3. **Analysis**:
   $$ \sigma_{0} (dB) = 10 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \frac{DN^2}{A_{n}^2} \right) $$
   *(Where $DN$ is the pixel intensity and $A_n$ is the calibration vector)*
4. **Classification**: Drought severity is classified based on deviation from historical baselines and absolute dielectric thresholds.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

- **Data Sovereignty**: User analysis data is processed ephemerally or stored in compliant regional databases.
- **Authentication**: Industry-standard JWT flows.
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded credentials; fully environment-variable driven configuration.
